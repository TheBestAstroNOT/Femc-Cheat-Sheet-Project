[f 2 1][vp 1 0 0 2 0 0][nl]-kun was appointed to the student council by the president herself. He's a responsible person.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][vp 1 0 0 3 0 0]That's why I didn't add him to the suspect list.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][vp 1 0 0 5 0 0]I thought you hated students who don't follow the rules.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 2 0 0]And this time it isn't just for a taste test.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 3 0 0]I think you'll actually be able to eat it![n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 4 0 0]...Wait, uh, maybe I said the same thing last time...[n][w][e]

[f 2 1]Fuuka presents me with a bento box.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1]There are rice balls wrapped[n]in seaweed inside.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1]They smell good. I decide to try one...[n][w][e]

[msg MND_002_0_0]
[f 2 1]It's edible, at least.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1]The rice tastes good, and it has[n]just the right amount of seasoning.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1]In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's delicious.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 11 0 0]You know how I said I was having trouble with cooking?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 12 0 0]Well, I decided to try and find a recipe that even I couldn't mess up.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 13 0 0]And after a lot of consideration... I thought maybe making rice balls is something I could handle.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 15 0 0]I made some rice balls today in home economics class too.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 16 0 0]I know it's a little silly to make something so basic in high school, but it was all I could manage.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 17 0 0]But then, everyone in the class told me they were really good, though![n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 18 0 0]Anyways, I've been really looking forward to have you try one, [nl]-chan.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 19 0 0]I wanted you to see how much progress I've made.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 20 0 0]Because, I don't think I could have made it this far without you.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 23 0 0]I know I've said this before, but...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 24 0 0]When I'm with you and the rest of the team, I'm able to see things more positively.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 26 0 0]That might be the reason why I made such good rice balls. Because I was thinking about who was going to eat them.[n][w][e]

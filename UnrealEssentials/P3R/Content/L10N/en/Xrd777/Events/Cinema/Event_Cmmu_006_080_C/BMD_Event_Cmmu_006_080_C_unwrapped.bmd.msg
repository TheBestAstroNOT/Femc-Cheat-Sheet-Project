[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 1 0 0]So, I tried putting my thoughts in order.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 2 0 0]I was so confused last time, I couldn't find the right words.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 3 0 0]I've said before, but I have a bad habit of thinking negatively. Like when I have a difficult time deciding on something.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 4 0 0]But no one knows what the future holds.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5 0 0]No matter how much you prepare, you can never really be sure what'll happen.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 6 0 0]So in situations like that, I think the most important thing you can do... is believe.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 7 0 0]You have to think positively, and trust that the future will smile upon you.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 3 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 9 0 0]I don't understand how it comes so naturally to everyone else.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 16 0 0]You don't have to think about it because it just comes naturally to you.[n][w][e]

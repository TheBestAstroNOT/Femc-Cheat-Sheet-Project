[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 1 0 0]...I decided I want to be able to make more than just rice balls.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 2 0 0]I started learning how to cook because I wanted to thank everyone for what they've done for me.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 3 0 0]But only knowing how to make rice balls isn't going to cut it.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 4 0 0]I told myself I needed to do something more, but then I started to doubt myself again.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5 0 0]That's when I thought of you, [nl]-chan.[n][w][e]

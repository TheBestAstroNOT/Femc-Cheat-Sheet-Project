[f 2 1][vp 1 0 0 4 0 0][f 5 21 0 4]Hey, Odagiri! What was that about? What did he mean by "for both our sakes"?[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 102 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5 0 0]He just wants to create a better school environment, so he simply asked a student fit for the job.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 102 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 6 0 0]Just like how the president asked her to join the student council to help out.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 102 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 10 0 0]Someone has broken school rules. It's only natural that I'm involved in finding and holding the transgressor accountable.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][vp 1 0 0 12 0 0][f 5 21 0 4]There was a cigarette found in the boys' bathroom... And in his eyes it doesn't matter if it's you or me. We're all suspects![n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 102 2 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 13 0 0]Quite the exaggeration. I'm not a crime scene investigator. I'm a member of the disciplinary committee.[n][w][e]

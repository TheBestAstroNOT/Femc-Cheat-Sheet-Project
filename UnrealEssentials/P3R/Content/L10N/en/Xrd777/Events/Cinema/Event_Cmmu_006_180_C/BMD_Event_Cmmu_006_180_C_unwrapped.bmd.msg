[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Fuuka Yamagishi]]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 0 0 0 2 0 0]Hm?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 3 0 0]The special ramen bowl and... an extra large side of rice?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 4 0 0]I am curious about that one, but it sounds like a lot of food.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_002_0_0 top]
[f 2 1]Probably.[e]
[f 2 1]You'd better not order that.[e]
[f 2 1]I'll eat your ramen for you.[e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5 0 0]Hmm, what to do...?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 6 0 0]I've heard you can eat more if you reduce the number of times that you chew.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 7 0 0]But then, I don't think you'd be able to really taste the food if you ate that way.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Fuuka Yamagishi]]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 8 0 0]You're probably right.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 9 0 0]Maybe if I was absolutely starving, I could handle that...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 10 0 0]But I had lunch today, so I'm not quite that hungry.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Fuuka Yamagishi]]
[f 2 1][bup 6 4 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 11 0 0]Huh? You'd offer to eat that?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 12 0 0][f 4 23 0 6 1 25 25][f 5 13 3 5 6]Then the only thing I'd have is the big bowl of rice![n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 14 0 0]I think I'll just go with a regular set meal. Okay, I'm ready to order.[n][w][e]

[msg MND_007_0_0]
[f 2 1]Our orders are ready.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1]The deep, rich flavor of the[n]broth fills me to my core.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 15 0 0]That was really good! It had a strong flavor, but went down so smoothly![n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 16 0 0]Food from a restaurant always tastes so amazing.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 17 0 0]You know, before I moved into the dorm, I'd never really eaten out that much.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 18 0 0]My parents always said that eating at home would give me more time to study.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 19 0 0]And whenever we ate, that's all we'd talk about. My upcoming tests, my post-graduation plans...[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_010_0_0 top]
[f 2 1]Sounds suffocating.[e]
[f 2 1]They're big on education, huh?[e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 20 0 0]...Yes. I suppose it was.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 21 0 0]Thinking back now, I don't even really remember the taste of my mom's cooking.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 22 0 0]Mhm.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 23 0 0]They even factored that into my diet. They said certain foods would boost my focus.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 24 0 0]I don't really remember how any of it tasted though. I was always too high-strung to notice.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 3 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 25 0 0]I... I really didn't want to disappoint my family.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 26 0 0]That's why I tried so hard to meet their expectations.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 3 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 27 0 0]But all they ever said to me was, "Try harder."[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 3 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 28 0 0]I was never good enough for them.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 3 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 29 0 0]And I think that's a big reason why I never had any confidence in myself.[n][w][e]

[msg MND_015_0_0]
[f 2 1]Fuuka opened up about her[n]family situation to me.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1]It seems we've grown closer...[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 31 0 0]Lightly crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside... I'd like to try making some myself one day.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 32 0 0]Plus, I bet it would be fun to make it together with someone...[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 33 0 0]Oh, but I'm not quite ready for that yet. I'd probably make so many mistakes.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_017_0_0 top]
[f 2 1]I think it'd be fine.[e]
[f 2 1]You're worrying too much.[e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 35 0 0]But if it doesn't come out well, wouldn't I just be wasting everyone's time?[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 36 0 0]I'm a little afraid that it might turn out like that, actually...[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 38 0 0]I'm thinking I'll take this opportunity to study how to make gyoza like the ones here.[n][w][e]
